# bootstraplandingpage
using bootstrap to create a landing page
i completed the html of the project, by this i have finished the skeleton part, the next thing to do now is to start the styling using SASS so that the work would look attractive and to the end accessible to the end user
The git ignore feature didnt allow some of the bootstrap actions to work effectively which pose a little delay in the develiopment of this project
I encountered a problem wheni was trying to add the accordion feature of the bootstrap, it took me several hours to fix it. the issue was linking the Js file to the Html, i used link instead of the script
